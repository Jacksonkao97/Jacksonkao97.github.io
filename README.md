### Description of Softwares/Components:
##### 1. GitHub:
   > A platform that provide hosting and version control features. For me, GitHub is just a free server that I can store my files and folders on it, it is similar to google cloud but with more features. One of the features that I liked and will want to share to you later is the hosting website using GitHub.
##### 2. Visual Studio Code:
   > A software/editor that allow people to coding/programming their project. I often uses vscode to programming my project, since vscode has a very range of language extension that allow me to programming different language on one editor such as .markdown, .javascript, .html, and etc. Also, people can access their files and folders on Github using vscode, which makes people life more easy.
#### 3. GitHub pages:
   > A website that provide very detail information about how to use host a website using GitHub.
#### 4. Jekll:
   > A website that provided a lot of template that free for everyone to use to aply to their resume or website. They also help people to host their resume or website locally.
